Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers. Results: DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a ""long tail"" of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific. Discussion: Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning). Conclusion: Deep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, both the size of literature databases and their lack of standardization hamper the automatic exploitation of the information contained in these resources. Text mining approaches have proven to be useful for the exploitation of information contained in the scientific publications. Here, we show that a knowledge-driven text mining approach can exploit a large literature database to extract a dataset of biomarkers related to diseases covering all therapeutic areas. Our methodology takes advantage of the annotation of MEDLINE publications pertaining to biomarkers with MeSH terms, narrowing the search to specific publications and, therefore, minimizing the false positive ratio. It is based on a dictionary-based named entity recognition system and a relation extraction module. The application of this methodology resulted in the identification of 131,012 disease-biomarker associations between 2,803 genes and 2,751 diseases, and represents a valuable knowledge base for those interested in disease-related biomarkers. Additionally, we present a bibliometric analysis of the journals reporting biomarker related information during the last 40 years. © 2014 À.

Yet, abstracts remain the focus of many publicly available literature data mining tools. Most literature mining tools rely on pre-existing lexicons of biological names, often extracted from curated gene or protein databases. This is a limitation, because such databases have low coverage of the many name variants which are used to refer to biological entities in the literature. Results: We present an approach to recognize named entities in full text. The approach collects high frequency terms in an article, and uses support vector machines (SVM) to identify biological entity names. It is also computationally efficient and robust to noise commonly found in full text material. We use the method to create a protein name dictionary from a set of 80,528 full text articles. Only 8.3% of the names in this dictionary match SwissProt description lines. We assess the quality of the dictionary by studying its protein name recognition performance in full text. Conclusion: This dictionary term lookup method compares favourably to other published methods, supporting the significance of our direct extraction approach. The method is strong in recognizing name variants not found in SwissProt. © 2005 Shi and Campagne; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Biological entities; Biological literatures; Computationally efficient; Direct extraction; Literature data; Literature mining; Protein database; Term extraction; Abstracting; Proteins; Support vector machines; Tools; Character recognition; accuracy; article; bioinformatics; controlled study; information processing; information processing device; intermethod comparison; nomenclature; performance; protein database; quality control; SWISS-PROT; algorithm; animal; artificial intelligence; bibliographic database; bibliometrics; biology; book; chemistry; classification; computer interface; documentation; genetic database; human; information dissemination; information retrieval; information service; Medline; natural language processing; protein database; system analysis; protein; Abstracting and Indexing as Topic; Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometrics; Computational Biology; Databases, Bibliographic; Databases, Genetic; Databases, Protein; Dictionaries as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Services; Information Storage and Retrieval; MEDLINE; Names; Natural Language Processing; Proteins; PubMed; Systems Integration; Terminology as Topic; User-Computer Interface",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Proteins","NLProt; Textractor; YAGI",,,,"Hersh, W., Bhupatiraju, R.T., Corley, S., Enhancing Access to the Bibliome: The TREC Genomics Track (2004) Medinfo, 2004, pp. 773-777; Yeh, A.S., Hirschman, L., Morgan, A.A., Evaluation of text data mining for database curation: Lessons learned from the KDD Challenge Cup (2003) Bioinformatics, 19 (SUPPL. 1), pp. i331-i339; Jenssen, T.K., Laegreid, A., Komorowski, J., Hovig, E., A literature network of human genes for high-throughput analysis of gene expression (2001) Nat.

This paper mainly discussed the research status of text mining technology applied in the biomedical field in recent 10 years in order to provide a reference for further studies of other researchers. Methods: Biomedical text mining literature included in SCI from 2004 to 2013 were retrieved and filtered and then were analyzed from the perspectives of annual changes, regional distribution, research institutions, journals sources, research fields, keywords and so on. Results: The total amount of global biomedical text mining literature is on the rise, among which literature relevant to named entity recognition, entity relation extraction, text categorization, text clustering, abbreviations extraction and co-occurrence analysis take up a large percentage; studies in USA and the UK are in the leading position. Conclusion: Compared with other much more mature research topics, the application of text mining technology in biomedicine is still a relatively new research field worldwide, while with the constantly improving awareness of this field and deepening researches in this area, a number of core research areas, core research institutes and core research fields have been formed in this field. Therefore, further researches of this field will inject new vitality in the development of biomedicine. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bibliometrics; Biomedical; Development trends; SCI; Text mining",,,,,,,,"Bayer, A.E., Folger, J., Some correlates of a citation measure of productivity in science (1966) Sociology of education, 39, pp. 381-390; Braun, T., Schubert, A.P., Kostoff, R.N., Growth and trends of fullerene research as reflected in its journal literature (2000) Chemical Reviews, 100 (1), pp. 23-38; de Solla Price, D.J., Beaver, D., Collaboration in an invisible college (1966) American Psychologist, 21 (11), p. 1011; Donaldson, I., Martin, J., De Bruijn, B., Wolting, C., Lay, V., Tuekam, B., Hogue, C.W., PreBIND and Textomy–mining the biomedical literature for protein–protein interactions using a support vector machine (2003) BMC bioinformatics, 4 (1), p. 11; Fleuren, W.W., Verhoeven, S., Frijters, R., Heupers, B., Polman, J., van Schaik, R., Alkema, W., CoPub update: CoPub 5.0 a text mining system to answer biological questions (2011) Nucleic Acids Research, 39, pp. 450-454; Frijters, R., Heupers, B., van Beek, P., Bouwhuis, M., van Schaik, R., de Vlieg, J., Alkema, W., CoPub: A literature-based keyword enrichment tool for microarray data analysis (2008) Nucleic Acids Research, 36, pp. 406-410; Han, J.S., Ho, Y.S., Global trends and performances of acupuncture research (2011) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 35 (3), pp. 680-687; He, M., Wang, Y., Li, W., PPI finder: A mining tool for human protein–protein interactions (2009) PLoS One, 4 (2), p. e4554; Hirsch, J.E., An index to quantify an individual’s scientific research output (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102 (46), pp. 16569-16572; Hirsch, J.E., Does the h index have predictive power?

Aim: This article compares strengths in nursing research between six mainly English-speaking nations (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States). Methods: Journal authorship (percentage of first authorship by nationality) and article keywords were compared for Scopus-indexed journal articles 2008–2018. Three natural language processing strategies were assessed for identifying statistically significant international differences in the use of keywords or phrases. Results: Journal author nationality was not a good indicator of international differences in research specialisms, but keyword and phrase differences were more promising especially if both are used. For this, the part of speech tagging and lemmatisation text processing strategies were helpful but not named entity recognition. The results highlight aspects of nursing research that were absent in some countries, such as papers about nursing administration and management. Conclusion: Researchers outside the United States should consider the importance of researching specific patient groups, diseases, treatments, skills, research methods and social perspectives for unresearched gaps with national relevance. From a methods perspective, keyword and phrase differences are useful to reveal international differences in nursing research topics. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Medical literature in PubMed from 1979 to 2019 were taken to analyze. Named-entity recognition (NER) method was applied to titles and abstracts to select articles about LS-SCLC. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were used in literature primary classification. The results were compared with the traditional manual retrieval way. Radiotherapy-related detailed concepts were labeled on these literature. Bibliometrics was taken to learn about hot topics of radiotherapy in LS-SCLC. Results: There are 891 articles related to LS-SCLC from PubMed. According to the first-level categories, there are 628 articles about treatments, among which 352 articles are classified into the second-level category of radiotherapy. Based on manual verification, the precision reaches to 98.9%. Totally 321 target articles are included in the analysis and labeled with radiotherapy-related concepts. The top labels in these articles are thoracic radiotherapy, dose/fractionation, toxicity and side effects, timing/sequence, prophylactic cranial irradiation, irradiation field, etc. The visualized result using impact factor (IF) shows that literature about dose/fractionation of thoracic radiotherapy are published more frequently in journals of high IF, and the number of literature keeps growing for years. Conclusions: Text mining has a good recall and precision ratio in hot topic analysis of radiotherapy for LS-SCLC. Dose/fractionation of thoracic radiotherapy is still a hotspot for LS-SCLC in recent years. © 2021, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Since currently there does not exist any automatic archiving of the obtained results, a lot of this information remains hidden in the textual details and is not easily accessible for further analysis. Hence, text mining methods and natural language processing techniques are used for the extraction of information from such publications.Named entity recognition, is a subtask that comes under information extraction that focuses on finding and categorizing specific entities in text. In this paper, bibliometric analysis of named entity recognition of ovarian cancer is carried out using information about publications from Scopus. The most productive journals, countries and authors are determined. The most frequently cited article and its citation history has been described. Also bibliometric maps based on citation network among countries are constructed. This study can assist people in the medical field to get a comprehensive understanding of the study of BioNER. It can also be utilized for reference works, for the research and application of the BioNER visualization methods. © 2021.
